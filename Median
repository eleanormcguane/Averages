/* Find the median of a given array of x length. The median is the number at the centre position in a sorted array.
   The first input number (x) is the length of the array. The following x numbers are the contents.
   1 Read in x and array contents
   2 Sort array numerically using bubble sort
   3 If odd number of elements, find centre point and print number stored there
   4 If even number of elements, find two centre points, find the mean of both and print
